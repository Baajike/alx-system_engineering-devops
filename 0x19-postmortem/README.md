# On-Call Management System

## Overview
The On-Call Management System is a crucial component in ensuring the reliability and availability of our digital services. This project aims to streamline the process of detecting and responding to incidents, ensuring minimal downtime and optimal user experience.

## Features
- **Incident Detection**: Monitoring tools are integrated to detect anomalies and trigger alerts in case of service disruptions.
- **On-Call Escalation**: Incidents are automatically escalated to on-call personnel based on predefined escalation policies.
- **Alert Notification**: On-call engineers are notified promptly through various channels, ensuring swift response to incidents.
- **Incident Management**: Engineers can acknowledge and resolve incidents efficiently, with the ability to escalate to other team members if needed.
- **Performance Metrics**: Metrics such as Medium Time to Acknowledgement (MTA) and Medium Time to Resolution (MTR) are tracked to measure system performance.

## Setup
To set up the On-Call Management System, follow these steps:
1. Configure monitoring tools to detect anomalies and trigger alerts.
2. Integrate monitoring tools with the on-call management platform, such as PagerDuty.
3. Define on-call teams and escalation policies within the on-call management platform.
4. Configure notification rules to ensure timely alerting of on-call personnel.

## Usage
1. **Incident Detection**: Monitoring tools detect anomalies and trigger alerts.
2. **Alert Notification**: On-call personnel receive alerts through PagerDuty or other notification channels.
3. **Incident Management**: On-call engineers acknowledge and resolve incidents, escalating to other team members if necessary.
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor performance metrics to track MTA and MTR and identify areas for improvement.
