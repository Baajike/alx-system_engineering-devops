## Contents
- `0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp`: Puppet configuration file for debugging a web server setup featuring Nginx under pressure. It addresses issues causing a high number of failed requests during benchmarking.
- `1-user_limit.pp`: Puppet configuration file for changing the operating system configuration to increase the maximum number of open files allowed for a specific user (`holberton` in this case).
